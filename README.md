# Servlet-GlassFish-Server

**Project Description:**

The ISBN Information Retrieval Servlet is a Java-based web application designed to retrieve and display information about books based on their International Standard Book Number (ISBN). It leverages servlet technology to provide a simple, user-friendly interface for querying book details.

**Key Features:**

1. ISBN Lookup: Users can enter an ISBN, and the servlet retrieves information about the book associated with that ISBN from a connected database.

2. Information Display: The servlet displays essential book details, including the book's title, author(s), and the number of pages.

3. Database Integration: The application is integrated with a database, allowing it to efficiently query and retrieve book information.

4. Error Handling: The servlet includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and unexpected input, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Technologies Used:**

Servlets: The core of the application is built using Java Servlet technology, which handles HTTP requests and responses.

Database Integration: The servlet interacts with a database to retrieve book information. In this example, it uses JDBC to connect to a Derby database.

HTML Forms: The application includes HTML forms for user input, allowing users to submit ISBNs for lookup.

**Usage:**

The ISBN Information Retrieval Servlet is a practical tool for anyone interested in quickly retrieving information about books by providing their ISBN. It can be used by book enthusiasts, librarians, or anyone who needs to access book details efficiently.

**Getting Started:**

To run the application, you need to set up a Derby database with appropriate book data and configure the database connection in the servlet code.
